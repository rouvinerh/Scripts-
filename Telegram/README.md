Just a bot I created to take in user orders as well as verify pictures that users send in order to process their order in a separate script. 
Written for fun and to help a friend out.

Yes I know global variables are terrible.

Basically automates his order intake, and automates that process to check payment and to process the order based on whether the transaction was complete or not.
